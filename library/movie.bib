В этом видео мы рассматриваем психологические преимущества периодического размышления о смерти - практики, корни которой уходят в глубь тысячелетий. Такое размышление и следующее за ним осознание может помочь найти себя и изменить свои привычки и жизнь, обрести необходимую мотивацию и стать стимулом под саморазвитие, очистить свою жизнь от лишнего, перестроить её под "минимализм" и глубокую осознанность. Цитаты из видео: "Колыбель качается над бездной, и здравый смысл говорит нам, что жизнь – только щель слабого света между двумя вечностями тьмы" (Владимир Набоков, "Говори, память: мемуары") “Как странно, что эта единственная очевидность и общность почти совсем не беспокоят людей и они менее всего чувствуют свое братство в смерти!” Фридрих Ницше, “Весёлая Наука” "Практически каждый большой мыслитель думал и писал о смерти… многие приходили к заключению, что смерть – неотъемлемая часть жизни, и, постоянно принимая ее в расчет, мы обогащаем жизнь, а отнюдь не обкрадываем ее". "Хотя физическая смерть разрушает человека, идея смерти может его спасти". (Ирвин Ялом, "Экзистенциальная психотерапия") "Те, кто среди стремлений и надежд живут исключительно в будущем, всегда смотрят вперед и с нетерпением спешат навстречу грядущему, которое только и должно дать им истинное счастье, в то время как настоящее проходит для них без внимания и неиспользованным, – эти люди, как ни строят они глубокомысленные лица, уподобляются итальянским ослам: чтобы заставить последних идти скорее, на прикрепленной к их голове палке вешают вязанку сена, которую они поэтому постоянно видят перед самыми глазами и надеются схватить. Ибо здесь человек сам отнимает у себя все свое существование, так как все время живет лишь ad interim (лат.: предварительно), – пока не умрет". (Артур Шопенгауэр, “О нашем поведении по отношению к себе”) "Цена любой вещи - это количество жизни, которое вы на нее обмениваете" (Генри Дэвид Торо) "Где нас ожидает смерть, мы не можем знать; поэтому, со своей стороны, ожидайте ее везде" (Сенека) "Ограниченность удовольствия только увеличивает его ценность" (Зигмунд Фрейд) "Только перед лицом смерти по-настоящему рождается человек" (Святой Августин)},
